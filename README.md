## What is the Library Application?

Library application is a software program designed to help users manage a library's collection of books. It is a web-based application built using the React library that provides users with a user-friendly interface to manage a library's collection of books and authors.

The application is divided into three main sections: a welcome section, an authors section, and a books section. The welcome section likely serves as an entry point to the application.

The authors section allows users to add new authors to the library's collection, view existing authors, and edit or delete author information as needed. The book section allows users to add new books to the library's collection, view existing books, and edit or delete book information as needed.

Overall, library application provides a streamlined and intuitive interface for managing a library's collection of books and authors, which could be useful for individuals or organizations that have a need to manage and track large collections of books or other media.

## Technologies and Methodologies

Library application is built using several technologies and libraries. These include:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces and applications.
- Sass: A CSS preprocessor that provides a more efficient way of writing CSS styles.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds type checking and other features to the language.
- Bootstrap: A CSS framework that provides pre-built components and styles for creating responsive web designs.
- Feather Icons: An open-source icon library that provides a collection of simple and elegant icons for use in web applications.
- React Number Format: A React component for formatting input fields with numerical data.
- SweetAlert2: A library for displaying beautiful and customizable alert messages in web applications.
- React Context API: A feature of React that provides a way to share state and functionality across components without the need for prop drilling. It allows for efficient and centralized state management in the application.

The application includes a backend connection implemented using the following methods:

- PUT: This method is used to update existing data on the server. It enables users to modify the details of books and authors in the library collection.
- POST: This method is used to create new data on the server. It allows users to add new books and authors to the library collection.
- DELETE: This method is used to remove data from the server. It provides the ability to delete books and authors from the library collection.
- GET: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. It allows users to fetch the list of books and authors from the library collection.

The implementation of these backend connections enhances the functionality of the library application, enabling users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the library collection.

In addition to these technologies, this application was developed using clean code principles, which emphasize writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. And also used Agile methodology and Kanban as your development methodology, which involves breaking down the development process into smaller tasks and working on them in an iterative and incremental manner.

Using these technologies and methodologies, a modern and efficient library application has been created that provides users with a user-friendly interface and real-time updates for managing a library's collection of books and authors.

## Suggestions for implementing 

There are several possible features and improvements that could be implemented in Library Application 2.0. Here are some suggestions:

- Search functionality: Add a search bar that allows users to search for books or authors by title, author name, or other criteria.

- User authentication and roles: Implement a user authentication system that allows different levels of access based on user roles. For example, librarians could have full access to add, edit, and delete books and authors, while regular users might only be able to view the collection.

- Integration with external databases: Allow users to import data from external databases like Google Books or Library of Congress to quickly add books to the collection.

- Reservation and borrowing system: Implement a reservation and borrowing system that allows users to reserve books and track their borrowing history.

- Social features: Add social features like user ratings, reviews, and recommendations to help users discover new books and authors.

- Integration with e-books: Allow users to access e-books or digital versions of books directly from the app.

- Analytics and reporting: Implement analytics and reporting features that allow librarians to track the usage and popularity of books, identify trends, and make informed decisions about collection management.

Overall, these features and improvements could help to make Library App 2.0 even more useful and efficient for managing a library's collection of books and authors.
